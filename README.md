# Threads App Clone - React, Json-Server, Docker

Thanks to [Ania Kubow](https://github.com/kubowania) for the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7HMa48mU3E&t=1218s&ab_channel=CodewithAniaKub%C3%B3w) on this React project. I have built on it and containerized it. 
- This is a simple application for learning new tools. The functionality is barebones at this point. 

- Front end is built using React.

- Json-Server is used to simulate a database.

- The entire application is containerized with Docker. 

### Wondering how to run both a Json-Server and a React front end in the same Docker container? 
### This repo can be used as reference for exactly that - running two servers within the same container. 

### Refer README.Docker.md for startup guide
